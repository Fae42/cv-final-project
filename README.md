# cv-final-project

## Introduction

This is a Final project of 2023 spring CS308(Computer Vision) course. It includes a GUI implement of [`Deepface`](https://github.com/serengil/deepface)(a lightweight face recognition and facial attribute analysis framework) and some experiments of [`Deepface`](https://github.com/serengil/deepface).

The GUI program has implemented some main features of [`Deepface`](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) such as `Face detect`, `Face attribute`, `Face matching` and `Face verification`.

## Set up

You can use the following command to import the required environment using `environment.yml`:

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

_note: some of the pip dependencies might not be a must. You can try to ignore some warnings or errors while importing them._


After importing the environment, you can run `main.py` to enter the main page.

## Usage

Let's take `Face attribute` as an example to show the usage of GUI program.
